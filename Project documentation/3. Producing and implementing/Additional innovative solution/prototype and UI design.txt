Propose an additional innovative solution using a prototype and user interface
(UI) design -&gt; Use Adobe XD to create a working interface prototype

Unfortunately my macbook isn't compatible with using Adobe XD even though I have access to the Creative cloud, so instead I had to use an
alterative in order to create a prototype user interface. After some research, I ended up choosing to try out 'Figma' for this prototype.
