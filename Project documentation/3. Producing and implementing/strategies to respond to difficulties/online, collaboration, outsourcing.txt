Strategies to respond to difficulies when developing a software engineering solution

In my own project, a large majority of what I had to quickly learn on Javascript was researched and learnt online, mainly through websites
and resources such as W3Schhols online web tutorials and looking for particular issues to an issue online with one example being with the
document.addEventListener feature that I was completely unfamiliar with when starting out this project. 

Another strategy I used with this code was collaborating with my peers and friends and family who was familiar with the coding language,
learning how things in javascript generally worked initially before then going further with my own research into the specifics for what
I had intended to achieve.
