The waterfall model follows, much alike a waterfall, a cascading downward process of 5 different stages. It has the logical progression of
steps throughout the life cycle, stages of 'falling water'. 

These stages include requirements, design, implementation, verification and maintanence. 

Some advantages of using the waterfall method of software development approaches is the clear project structure, improved risk management,
set costs and enhanced accountability. It does however still has some disadvantages as well, with some of those including its limited
flexibility, deadlines required and limited options for client feedback.

The scale and types of developments which use the waterfall development approach largely are ones which have less complicated objectives and predictable outcomes.
