Research and use the Waterfall software development approach including ...
- logical progression of steps throughout the life cycle, stages of 'falling water', advantages and disadvantages, scale and types of developments

research and use the agile software development approach including ...
- rate of developing a final solution, method tailoring, iteraction workflow and scale and type of developments

research the WAgile software development approach
- understanding it is a hybrid model
- analysis of the 'when' and 'how' intervention is applied during the development life cycle
scale and types of developments

apply project management to plan and conduct the development and implementation of a project and software engineering solution.
- scheduling and tracking using a software tool, including Gantt charts
- using collaboration tools

explore social and ethical issues associated with project work, including working individually, collaboratively and responding to stakeholders
explore communication issues associated with project work including...
- involving and empoering rhe client, enabling feedback and negotiating

Investigate how software engineering solution are quality assured
- defining criteria on which quality will be judged
- ensuring requirements are met using a continious checking progress
- addressing compliance and legislative requirements

demonstrate the use of modelling tools
