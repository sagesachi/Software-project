Data structures

- Arrays
Arrays serve as the foundation for other structures such as lists and hash tables, storing similar items together at contingous locations. 

- Stack
A stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order, using a last in, first out (LIFO) structure. 

- Linked lists 
Linked lists consist of nodes with some sort of pointer and data being then directed to another node in the series, and is a linear
data structure. 

- Binary trees
Non linear data structure which consists of nodes with two potential values of direction. 

- Hash tables
Used to insert, look up and remove key-value pairs quickly while operating on the concept of 'hashing'.
