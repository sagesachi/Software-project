One example of a reasonable possibility for strucutirng important data may be its impact on the code structure in reorganising and
managing how variables may be accessed say in an array for example and how easy it is to then identify certain variables through an
index. It impacts the way in which the code structure is then layed out, sectioning certain aspects into different parts based on
its attributes or such. 

Another possibility includes the general readability of the code for it to not be displayed potentially as bulky and hard to read, making
it easier then to identify where one might have made a mistake in the instance that occurs as well as easily acccessing and finding
what you intend to. The possibility of structuring important data additionally might be because of the resulting overall efficiency of
the program which can run better due to its easy sorting and prior organisation then being easier to make changes and be efficient in 
making the most of what can be done in as little lines of code as possible for it to consequently take less time.
