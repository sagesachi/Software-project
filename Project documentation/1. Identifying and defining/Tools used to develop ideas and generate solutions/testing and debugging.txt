In testing and debugging my original python code for which I had planned out to use, I quickly realised that python wasn't easily able to
be transfered and implemented into hmtl to create the website game I wanted to create for this project. In learning this, I had to resort
to other potential ways of implementing my code using this python code generation idea as a base for which I then intended to create,
researching and learning what I could of the basics of Java Script so I could then rewrite my intended code in python, utilising the way it
functions to my advantage as I tried to implement what I had planned for this project.

One bug and problem I initially ran into in completing this project was the use of github and its capability to test code for example. In
order to fix this, I downloaded the files from this github project and all of its code onto my computer to then open it with visual studio
code to then test out the new Javascript code and how it was working and linking to the html and after a few revisions got it initially
working.
