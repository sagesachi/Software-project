Direct implementation

A direct implementation approach removes an old system before then putting the new one in its place without any sort of
overlap or limited roll out much like other software implementation methods. 

It's a risky approach due to the fact that you are then unable to gain any testing feedback by users other than those working on it who may
have a different perspective and only have that chance once everyone has already gotten the new system, then therefore having to take time
to then fix any changes needed and do so for all users and may in result impact upon a company and their performance.
