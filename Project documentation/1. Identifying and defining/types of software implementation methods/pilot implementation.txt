Pilot implementation

Pilot implementation, unlike other software implementation methods, deploys and rolls out new software systems to a select small group of
participants and users who can then test it in a controlled space.

Instead of rolling out a new system all at once for all users, pilot implementation allows for more specified user feedback and testing. It
does however potentially have the risk of other users to later identify problems that pilot testing users didn't run into however it still
reduces the risk as it is able to recieve feedback with others testing a system with time to then still implement changes before it 
officially all is released.
