Parallel implementation

The parallel implementation method is a relatively popular software implementation method as it is generally low risk and runs the new
system alongside the old one for a certain period of time but having both running before then fully switching over to the new system. 

It's the simultanous running of both the new system and the old at once so the old one is still available and there as a backup however
users can still try out the new system, testing it for any issues and giving feedback before it is fully implemented into place so as to
have time for revising if needed.
